    # po: As no-one survived at Blackwater, people assume that both attacks were by the same villain, who is male.
    # The Academy has understood data protection, and does not identify students expelled for necromancy, so that a mob don't attack their family.
    description=_ "In 23 YW, a necromancer ransacked Blackwater Port and Carcyn. Noâ€“one was left alive to tell the tale in Blackwater, but those who survived in Carcyn told of the necromancer recruiting ruffians and apprentice mages to his cult.

Three months after the attack on Carcyn, an army of undead came out of the Northlands. They were met by a huge force unified against necromancy, but that battle was lost. The army of undead next turned towards Elensefar.

Now the few who remained in Elensefar must hope to defend. A single-scenario campaign.

Incomplete: still being balanced."
